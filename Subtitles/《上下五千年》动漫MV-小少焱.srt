00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,832
更像是我中华的翅
are soaring higher with our Chinese wings.

149
00:04:07,867 --> 00:04:09,432
从盘古到这清末
From Pangu to the end of the Qing dynasty,

150
00:04:09,467 --> 00:04:10,932
又怎能就此别过
how could we stop there?

151
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:12,232
这五千年的颜色
The colors of these 5,000 years

152
00:04:12,367 --> 00:04:13,966
仍在为了你我而烁
continue to shine for you and me.

153
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:15,532
我华夏儿女的乡
My ancestral home of the Chinese people

154
00:04:15,633 --> 00:04:17,099
自古是礼仪之邦
has always been a land of rituals and ceremonies since ancient times,

155
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:18,699
而这个古老的东方
and this ancient East

156
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:20,266
立在了世界中央
stood in the center of the world.

157
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,732
今日的阳光普照
Today's sunlight shines everywhere,

158
00:04:21,767 --> 00:04:23,399
是前人给的依靠
thanks to the efforts of our ancient ancestors.

159
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,899
此生第一个骄傲
The first pride in this life

160
00:04:24,933 --> 00:04:26,399
是生来有的荣耀
is the glory we were born with.

161
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,932
这中华上下五千年
Up and down these 5,000 years of Chinese history,

162
00:04:28,033 --> 00:04:29,532
有多少话还未言
there are many stories still untold.

163
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,032
还会有沧海桑田
The blue sea will continue turning into mulberry fields (drastic changes are the ups and downs of life).

164
00:04:31,067 --> 00:04:32,532
由你我来续前缘
It is up to us to continue this frontier.

165
00:04:32,567 --> 00:04:33,866
我等炎黄子孙
As the descendants of the Flame Emperor and Yellow Emperor,

166
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,399
早已骨血难分
our blood and bones have already become inseparable long ago.

167
00:04:35,467 --> 00:04:36,932
若还热血尚温
If our passion still burns brightly,

168
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,666
看我一笔乾坤
watch us move heaven and earth with one mighty stroke of a pen.
